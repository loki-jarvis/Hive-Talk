# Hive_Talk
### DESCRIPTION 
A chatting application based on the ipfs where two person chat each other in real time. Chat is accessible using metamask address only so that it provide privacy.
         
 Blockchain technology provides the world with a more secure and efficient. The need for privacy, data security, and easy to implement systems has long been the focus of corporations seeking to keep their companies internal workings private and person also. The private sector shares these concerns with the corporate world.
 
WHAT THIS SOLVE ?

Existing systems work on the principal of keeping persistent TCP connection between users and server to facilitate communication between end users. Whatsapp.inc recently claimed to possess reached a capacity of 1 million established TCP connection on one machine. This method is dear and not feasible on ensure continued growth, these systems have to be added with extra machines to handle such connections. this can increase in cost and usage of electrcity which isn’t ecofriendly. If we include redundent systems for backup’s the amount just increases. Also a giant concern in such centralized system architecture is security, as all the information is stored in central servers they're susceptible to attacks. All correspondence goes through the server of the corporate owning the messaging app, and also the company can dictate its rules: block messages on a particular subject or prohibit the transfer of certain files. the corporate may additionally be subject to government pressures and should be asked to disclose users’ correspondence or to impose certain restrictions upon their request.The proposed solution may provide free from any form of centralization and only uses a psuedo server for peer-discovery(ipfs).

Technology that we used:-
* IPFS :- FOR PERSISTANT STORAGE PURPOSE
* ORBITDB :- STORE ALL THE DATA AND IN LOCAL BROWSER STORAGE ALSO
* VUE :-  FOR MORE RESPONSIVE
* TAILWIND CSS :- MORE STYLISH
* RANDOM USER API :- USED TO CREATE RANDOM USERNAME
* EVENTEMITTER :- USED FOR THE PUBSUB MODEL

How did the technology benefit your project?
* Serverless 
* Distributed database 
* Does not have any central database center
* Privacy

# Steps to run the code:

We will need two IDs for testing this, so we can create one in Google Chrome and one in Microsoft edge.

Once we have an ID we can connect to the application.
